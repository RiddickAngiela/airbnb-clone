      <h2>Company History</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by her passion for travel and her desire to bridge the gap between tourists and local culture, Sarah Myles envisioned a platform that went beyond the typical Airbnb rental. She saw an opportunity to create a space where travelers could immerse themselves in the heartbeat of a neighborhood, engage with locals, and contribute positively to the community they were visiting.
